# A simple temperature converter made in Java

> Aimed at students trying to learn the concepts of primitive types and while loops

`Note that this converter only accepts [,] and throws an input mismatch exception when using periods [.] .` <br />
`This is done on purpose to avoid copy/pasting this template into e.g. high school coding contests`
